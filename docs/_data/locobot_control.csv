Argument,Description,Default Value
robot_model,model type of the Interbotix LoCoBot such as 'locobot_base' or 'locobot_wx250s',""""""
robot_name,name of the robot (could be anything but defaults to 'locobot'),"""locobot"""
show_gripper_bar,"if true, the gripper_bar link is included in the 'robot_description' parameter; if false, the gripper_bar and finger links are not loaded to the parameter server. Set to false if you have a custom gripper attachment",true
show_gripper_fingers,"if true, the gripper fingers are included in the 'robot_description' parameter; if false, the gripper finger links are not loaded to the parameter server. Set to false if you have custom gripper fingers",true
external_urdf_loc,the file path to the custom urdf.xacro file that you would like to include in the Interbotix robot's urdf.xacro file,""""""
use_rviz,"launches RViz; if you are SSH'd into the robot, DON'T set this to true",false
rviz_frame,fixed frame in RViz; this should be changed to ``map`` or ``<robot_name>/odom`` if mapping or using local odometry respectively,$(arg robot_name)/base_footprint
use_base,"if true, the base ROS nodes are launched",false
use_dock,"if true, loads base AutoDock features (only for the Kobuki version)",false
use_lidar,"if true, the RPLidar node is launched",false
show_lidar,set to true if the lidar is installed on the robot; this will load the lidar related links to the 'robot_description' parameter,$(arg use_lidar)
use_camera,"if true, the RealSense D435 camera nodes are launched",false
filters,"types of RealSense camera filters to use (in this case, the 'pointcloud' filter is needed)",pointcloud
align_depth,whether to publish topics with the depth stream aligned with the color stream,false
color_fps,frame rate of the color images taken on the RealSense camera,30
depth_fps,frame rate of the depth images taken on the RealSense camera,30
color_width,horizontal resolution of the color images taken on the RealSense camera,640
color_height,vertical resolution of the color images taken on the RealSense camera,480
motor_configs,the file path to the 'motor config' YAML file,`refer to xslocobot_control.launch`_
mode_configs,the file path to the 'mode config' YAML file,`refer to xslocobot_control.launch`_
load_configs,"a boolean that specifies whether or not the initial register values (under the 'motors' heading) in a Motor Config file should be written to the motors; as the values being written are stored in each motor's EEPROM (which means the values are retained even after a power cycle), this can be set to false after the first time using the robot. Setting to false also shortens the node startup time by a few seconds and preserves the life of the EEPROM",true
use_sim,"if true, the DYNAMIXEL simulator node is run; use RViz to visualize the robot's motion; if false, the real DYNAMIXEL driver node is run",false
