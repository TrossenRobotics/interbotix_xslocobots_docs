Argument,Description,Default Value
robot_model,model type of the Interbotix LoCoBot such as 'locobot_base' or 'locobot_wx250s',""""""
robot_name,name of the robot (could be anything but defaults to 'locobot'),"""locobot"""
show_lidar,set to 'true' if the lidar is installed on the robot; this will load the lidar related links to the 'robot_description' parameter for collision purposes;,false
external_urdf_loc,the file path to the custom urdf.xacro file that you would like to include in the Interbotix robot's urdf.xacro file,""""""
external_srdf_loc,the file path to the custom srdf.xacro file that you would like to include in the Interbotix robot's srdf.xacro file. Note that this should only contain 'disable collision' tags for collisions between the original Interbotix Arm and other links that are defined in the file specified by external_urdf_loc,""""""
mode_configs,the file path to the 'mode config' YAML file,refer to `xslocobot_moveit_interface.launch`_
use_gazebo,launch MoveIt with a Gazebo simulated robot,false
use_actual,launch MoveIt with the physical robot,false
use_fake,launch MoveIt with a MoveIt generated fake robot,false
dof,the degrees of freedom of the arm,5
use_camera,"if true, the RealSense D435 camera nodes are launched; note that the main idea behind this is to generate an Occupancy Map for MoveIt to use when collision checking; however, this feature is not fully implemented yet",false
use_moveit_rviz,"set to false if you would like to use MoveIt in a headless state; otherwise, set to true to display RViz with the MoveIt plugin",true
world_name,the file path to the Gazebo 'world' file to load (if simulating),refer to `xslocobot_moveit_interface.launch`_
use_cpp_interface,launch the custom C++ API node,false
moveit_interface_gui,launch a custom GUI to interface with the **moveit_interface** node so that you can command specific end-effector poses (defined by 'ee_gripper_link'),true
use_python_interface,launch the Python Interface Tutorial node,false
